				<h2>Introdution</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Dawid Kawka, and this set of small projects is my Web Dev Project. This website consists of 2 main pages: the hex viewer and the 3D engine. Each of these smaller projects has basic information on how to use them directly on the page, however I also added 2 smaller pages which describe how to use them in a bit more detail. Below you can find short descriptions of each project.

					<h2>Hex Viewer</h2>
					<p>
						A hex viewer is a program which displays data as hexadecimal numbers.
						It reads files as bytes, and then displays those bytes to the user as hexadecimal numbers.
						Hex viewers and hex editors are often used for displaying binary data such as compiled code, as they show a clear image of where each byte is in memory, as well as what value it has.
					</p>
					<p>
						My hex viewer can read bytes from files as well as bytes generated through javascript code, and it will update the page live to reflect those changes as soon as they happen.
						It also supports highlighting data values, although controlling this functionality is currently not possible through the web interface and has to be done through the javascript console.
